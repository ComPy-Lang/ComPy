# ComPy

ComPy-Lang is a new compiled programming language, designed to target the domain of ‘Scientific Computing’. It will have a simple syntax and adequate performance compared to other similar languages. It will provide all the required optimizations for numeric computations (using [libasr](https://github.com/lcompilers/libasr)-LFortran).
The ComPy compiler is an ‘ahead-of-time’ compiler. In addition to these compilation steps, it provides understandable error messages and also runtime libraries for numerical computations.

# Installation

For now, ComPy works on Linux.

## Install Conda

If you do not have Conda already installed, please follow the instructions
here to install Conda for your platform:

https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/#unix-like-platforms

Install required packages (Linux-64 bit), If already installed, continue:

    sudo apt install binutils-dev zlib1g-dev

## To compile ComPy follow the instructions

Create a Conda environment:

    conda create -n cp llvmdev=11.0.1 bison=3.4 re2c python cmake make toml numpy
    conda activate cp

Clone ComPy

    git clone https://github.com/ComPy-Lang/ComPy.git
    cd ComPy

Create autogenerated files (choose the command for your platform):

    ./build0.sh

Compile ComPy:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_LLVM=yes -DWITH_STACKTRACE=yes -DWITH_LFORTRAN_BINARY_MODFILES=no .
    cmake --build . -j16

To check the version, use:

    ./src/bin/compy --version
