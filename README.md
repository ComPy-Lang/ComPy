# ComPy

ComPy is a new compiled programming language, designed targeting the domain of ‘Scientific Computing’. It will have a simple syntax and adequate performance than other similar languages. It will provide all the required optimizations for numeric computations (using libasr-LFortran). The ComPy compiler is an ‘Ahead-of-time’ compiler that will turn modules written in a subset of ComPy into native ones. In addition to these compilation steps, it provides understandable error messages and also runtime libraries for numerical computations.
